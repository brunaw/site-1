Music information retrieval is a recent study 
field, with a wide range of topics yet to be
explored. It combines computational tools with 
theory to amplify the utility and applications of 
music and audio data. These data has many forms
of representation, each one carrying different
levels of information. Music, for example, can be 
represented by music sheets, chords, lyrics, 
MIDI and audio files, and so on.

This blog has as one if its main goals to explore
these different type of data in R. Some of the packages
used here are:

  - [`vagalumeR`](https://github.com/r-music/vagalumeR)
  - [`chorrrds`](https://github.com/r-music/chorrrds)
  - [`music21`](https://github.com/r-music/music21)
  - [`tabr`](https://github.com/leonawicz/tabr)
  - [`Rspotify`](https://github.com/tiagomendesdantas/Rspotify)
  - [`seewave`](https://github.com/cran/seewave)
